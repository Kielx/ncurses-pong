## About the project

This PONG game serves as an introduction to C++ programming using the Ncurses library. I wanted to solidify my knowledge about the Ncurses library and thought that it would be a good way to write a few blog posts about C++ programming. A full tutorial in English/polish on how to write this game is available on [Pantak.net](https://blog.pantak.net/posts/CppNcurses1)
